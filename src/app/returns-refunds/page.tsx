          All items are manufactured to your personal specific requirements and therefore cannot be
          returned. Refunds will not be offered unless the item received by the customer was damaged
          or incorrectly manufactured.

        <p>
          The only time we can accept a return on a made-to-measure product is if it has arrived
          damaged, has not been made to your specifications, or has a defect. Upon image
          confirmation of damage, mistake or defect, we will re-make your product free of charge to
          the original specifications provided and arrange collection of your unwanted item. Please
          note, no changes can be made to your original specifications at this stage & the order
          cannot be cancelled once it has been made.
